Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories, the Center for Particle Astrophysics at the Santa Barbara, San Diego, and Berkeley campuses of the University of California, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Our primary aim was to test the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way is made up of objects like brown dwarfs or planets: these objects have come to be known as MACHOs, for MAssive Compact Halo Objects. The signature of these objects is the occasional amplification of the light from extragalactic stars by the gravitational lens effect. The amplification can be large, but events are extremely rare: it was necessary to monitor photometrically several million stars for a period of 10 years in order to obtain a useful detection rate. For this purpose we built a two channel system that employed eight 2048*2048 CCDs, mounted on the 50 inch telescope at Mt. Stromlo. The MACHO project data archive consists of approximately 127,000 two-colour images of fields collected between 1992 and 2003 covering the large and small Magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge and two-colour light-curves for approximately 18 million stars in the LMC and galactic bulge.","The Australian National University Supercomputer Facility","#Optical#","ivo://anusf.anu.au/macho/image/SIAP","2009-01-29T13:40:30Z","#optical astronomy#light curves#dark matter#","#Catalog#","#Research#General#",,"1.0","SimpleImageAccess","ivo://ivoa.net/std/SIA","4","ParamHTTP",,"std","http://macho.anu.edu.au/image/siap?",,,"1000000",,"http://wwwmacho.anu.edu.au"

It carries 3 high throughput X-ray telescopes with an unprecedented effective area, and an optical monitor, the first flown on a X-ray observatory. The large collecting area and ability to make long uninterrupted exposures provide highly sensitive observations. Since Earth's atmosphere blocks out all X-rays, only a telescope in space can detect and study celestial X-ray sources. The XMM-Newton mission is helping scientists to solve a number of cosmic mysteries, ranging from the enigmatic black holes to the origins of the Universe itself.

The Region S861 was initially chosen because it represented the combination of the deepest UK Schmidt plate material (the best optical survey material available at the time of the sample definition in 1989) and the highest galactic latitude, thereby emphasizing the extragalactic nature of the survey and also maximizing the likelihood of having more optical detections. Much more recently, the area of this plate has been covered by a number of important sky surveys including 2MASS, NRAO VLA FIRST, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) which is now public.

The data are useful for studying star formation, low-level nuclear activity, and UV emission by evolved stellar populations in galaxies. At the HST resolution (~ 0.05''), the images display an assortment of morphologies and UV brightnesses. These include bright nuclear point sources, compact young star clusters scattered in the field or arranged in circumnuclear rings, centrally-peaked diffuse light distributions, and galaxies with weak or undetected UV emission.

"#Images#",,"Tirgo IR Archive","The Archive is formed with all files measured with ARcetri Near Infrared CAmera ( ARNICA). Each files contains (in FITS format) or a single exposure or the mean of single exposures taken at the same telescope position. The filer used can be either a Johnson broad band infrared filter (J, H, K), or a narrow band filter (see ARNICA) page for details). Most measures was acquired at the TIRGO telescope, while a smaller sample cames from the few telescopes Arnica was ported to (WHT, NOT, VATT and TNG). All frame are in FITS format and are 256x256 pixels in size. The archive contains more than 250.000 frames. Most files belongs to a compound measure (we call them ""a mosaic"").","IA2",,"ivo://ia2.inaf.it/hosted/tirgo/arnica","2011-04-04T12:06:02Z","#NIR small telescope imaging#","#Archive#","#Research#",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://tirgo.arcetri.astro.it/archivio/help.html"
"#Images#","XCATDBDR3-SIA","Epic Image SIAP of the SSC Interface for the 2XMMi DR3 Catalogue","The 2XMMi-DR3 catalogue is the fifth publicly released XMM X-ray source catalogue produced by the XMM Survey Science Centre (SSC) consortium on behalf of ESA. It follows the 1XMM (released in April 2003), 2XMMp (July 2006), 2XMM (August 2007) and 2XMMi (August 2008) catalogues: 2XMMp was a preliminary version of 2XMM. 2XMMi and 2XMMi-DR3 are incremental versions of the 2XMM catalogue. With this increment catalogue, for the first time, as part of the catalogue naming convention we introduce the concept of a data release (DR) as a means of distinguishing between increments. This is being applied only to the 2XMM generation of catalogues. In this scheme (see following table), 2XMM is considered as DR1, 2XMMi as DR2 and the present catalogue as DR3.","Observatory of Strasbourg, SSC Team",,"ivo://xcatdb/2xmmidr3/epicsia","2010-11-16T14:13:10Z","#EPIC Image of 2XMMi DR3 filed of views#",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1000",,"http://xmmssc-www.star.le.ac.uk/Catalogue/xcat_public.html"
