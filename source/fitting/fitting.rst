Fitting and Modeling 1-D and 2-D Data
=====================================

Workshop goals are to use Sherpa to:

- Learn the basics of modeling and fitting with Sherpa by fitting a 1D
  dataset (the spatial profile of the HST/STIS observation of 3C270
  from the `Introduction to NumPy <../core/numpy_scipy.html#plot-the-spatial-profile-and-raw-spectrum>`_)

- Fit a MAST spectrum of 3C 273 (1D with errors)

- Fit a Chandra image of G21.5-0.9 (2D)

- Fit the MAST 3C 273 data using the low-level API
